# üìã YOUR PROJECT LINK FOR DOCUMENTATION

## üéØ FINAL STEPS TO GET YOUR GITHUB LINK

Since I cannot access your GitHub account directly, **you need to follow these 3 simple steps:**

---

## STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in:**
   - Repository name: `tata-steel-stock-forecast`
   - Description: `ML pipeline for stock price forecasting using XGBoost`
   - Make it **Public** (for portfolio)
   - ‚ùå Don't add README, .gitignore, or license

3. **Click:** "Create repository"

---

## STEP 2: Push Your Code

**Open PowerShell** and run these 2 commands:

```powershell
# Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tata-steel-stock-forecast.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**When asked for password:** Use a Personal Access Token (not your password)
- Get token here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Generate new token ‚Üí Check "repo" ‚Üí Copy token
- Use token as password when pushing

---

## STEP 3: Get Your Project Link

After successful push, your project will be at:

```
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tata-steel-stock-forecast
```
