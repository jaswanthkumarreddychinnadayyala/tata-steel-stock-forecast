## ‚úÖ What's Ready
- All files committed to git locally
- 30+ files ready to push
- Complete documentation included

---

## üìù STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. **Open your browser and go to:** https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in repository details:**
   - Repository name: `tata-steel-stock-forecast`
   - Description: `ML pipeline for stock price forecasting using XGBoost, feature engineering, and time-series validation`
   - Visibility: **Public** (recommended for portfolio)
   - ‚ùå **DO NOT CHECK:** Add a README file, .gitignore, or license

3. **Click:** "Create repository"

---

### Step 2: Copy Your Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a URL like:

```
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tata-steel-stock-forecast.git
```

**COPY THIS URL!** You'll need it in the next step.

---

### Step 3: Run These Commands

Open PowerShell in your project folder (`C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\stocks`) and run:

#### Command 1: Add GitHub Remote
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tata-steel-stock-forecast.git
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è REPLACE `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

#### Command 2: Push to GitHub
```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

---

### Step 4: Authentication

When you run `git push`, you'll be asked for credentials:

**Option A: Personal Access Token (Recommended)**

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click: "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: "Stock Forecast Project"
4. Expiration: 90 days
5. Check: ‚úÖ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
6. Click: "Generate token"
7. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

When pushing:
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: **Paste the token** (NOT your GitHub password)

**Option B: GitHub CLI (Easier)**
```powershell
# Install GitHub CLI
winget install GitHub.cli

# Login
gh auth login

# Then push normally
git push -u origin main
```

---

## üéØ YOUR PROJECT LINK

After successful push, your project will be at:

```
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tata-steel-stock-forecast
```

**‚≠ê THIS IS THE LINK TO SAVE IN YOUR DOCUMENT!**

---

## üìã COMPLETE COMMAND SEQUENCE

Copy and paste these commands one by one:

```powershell
# 1. Navigate to project (if not already there)
cd C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\stocks

# 2. Verify git status
git status

# 3. Add remote (REPLACE YOUR-USERNAME!)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tata-steel-stock-forecast.git

# 4. Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```
